You've started a new movie-rating website, and you've been collecting data on reviewers' ratings of various movies. There's not much data yet, but you can still try out some interesting queries. Here's the schema: 

Movie ( mID, title, year, director ) 
English: There is a movie with ID number mID, a title, a release year, and a director. 

Reviewer ( rID, name ) 
English: The reviewer with ID number rID has a certain name. 

Rating ( rID, mID, stars, ratingDate ) 
English: The reviewer rID gave the movie mIDa number of stars rating (1-5) on a certain ratingDate. 

Your queries will run over a small data set conforming to the schema. View the database. (You can also download the schema and data.)

Question 5

For all pairs of reviewers such that both reviewers gave a rating to the same movie, return the names of both reviewers. Eliminate duplicates, don't pair reviewers with themselves, and include each pair only once. For each pair, return the names in the pair in alphabetical order. 
 
select nameFirst, nameSecond
from (select distinct nameFirst, nameSecond
from (select R1.rID as rIDFirst, R2.rID as rIDSecond
from Rating R1 join Rating R2 using(mID)
where R1.mID = R2.mID and R1.rID <> R2.rID)
join
(select rID as rIDFirst, name as nameFirst
from Reviewer) using(rIDFirst)
join
(select rID as rIDSecond, name as nameSecond
from Reviewer) using(rIDSecond)
order by nameFirst)
where nameFirst < nameSecond
