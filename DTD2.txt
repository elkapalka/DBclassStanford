In this question, you are to create a DTD for a small XML data set drawn from the Stanford course catalog. There are multiple departments, each with a department chair, some courses, and professors and/or lecturers who teach courses. The XML data is here. 

Write a DTD for the XML data set. 

Important: Do not include <!DOCTYPE Course_Catalog [...]> in your DTD. Your DTD should start with <!ELEMENT Course_Catalog (Department*)>.
