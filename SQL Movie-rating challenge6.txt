These problems are more challenging than those in the core set. Try them out to test your skills (and perhaps earn a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction). 

You've started a new movie-rating website, and you've been collecting data on reviewers' ratings of various movies. There's not much data yet, but you can still try out some interesting queries. Here's the schema: 

Movie ( mID, title, year, director ) 
English: There is a movie with ID number mID, a title, a release year, and a director. 

Reviewer ( rID, name ) 
English: The reviewer with ID number rID has a certain name. 

Rating ( rID, mID, stars, ratingDate ) 
English: The reviewer rID gave the movie mIDa number of stars rating (1-5) on a certain ratingDate. 

Your queries will run over a small data set conforming to the schema. View the database. (You can also download the schema and data.)

Question 6

For each director, return the director's name together with the title(s) of the movie(s) they directed that received the highest rating among all of their movies, and the value of that rating. Ignore movies whose director is NULL. 

select distinct director, title, stars
from (select *
from Rating join Movie on(Rating.mid=Movie.mid) ) as B
where not exists (select * from Rating join Movie using(mID) where B.director = director and B.stars < stars) and not director is null
