Students at your hometown high school have decided to organize their social network using databases. So far, they have collected information about sixteen students in four grades, 9-12. Here's the schema: 

Highschooler ( ID, name, grade ) 
English: There is a high school student with unique ID and a given first name in a certain grade. 

Friend ( ID1, ID2 ) 
English: The student with ID1 is friends with the student with ID2. Friendship is mutual, so if (123, 456) is in the Friend table, so is (456, 123). 

Likes ( ID1, ID2 ) 
English: The student with ID1 likes the student with ID2. Liking someone is not necessarily mutual, so if (123, 456) is in the Likes table, there is no guarantee that (456, 123) is also present. 

Your queries will run over a small data set conforming to the schema. View the database. (You can also download the schema and data.)

Question 2

For every student who likes someone 2 or more grades younger than themselves, return that student's name and grade, and the name and grade of the student they like. 

select H1.name, H1.grade,  H2.name, H2.grade from Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2, Likes
where  H1.id= Likes.id1 and H2.id= Likes.id2 and H1.grade-H2.grade>=2
